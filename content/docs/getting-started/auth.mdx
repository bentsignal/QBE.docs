## Setup

1. Login or sign up for a [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
2. Create a new project.

   _Note_: The custom auth components in the app are only configured to use Google SSO out of the box, but can be modified to use whatever you'd like.

3. Create a new JWT Template

   - Navigate to the **JWT Templates** section and create a new template. Use the Convex preset, and do not make any changes.

4. Create a new Webhook

   1. Grab your convex HTTP actions URL from the Convex dashboard

      `Settings -> URL & Deploy Key`

   2. In the Clerk dashboard, go to

      `Configure -> Webhooks -> Add endpoint`

   3. Create a new endpoint:
      - URL: `<your-convex-http-actions-url>/clerk/events`
      - Event type
        - user.created
   4. Grab the signing secret from Clerk, and set it in the Convex environment variables.
      ```bash
      CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-webhook-secret>
      ```

5. Now we just need to grab the remaining API Keys and environment variables necessary for both Next.js and Convex. For information on applying
   environment variables, refer to [the environment variables section](/getting-started/env).

   ### Next.js

   ```
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-publishable-key>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=<your-frontend-api-url>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/login
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
   ```

   ### Convex

   ```
   CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=<your-frontend-api-url>
   ```
