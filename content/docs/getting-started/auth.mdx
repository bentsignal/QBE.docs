## Setup

1. Login or sign up for a [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
2. Create a new project. The custom auth components in the app are only configured to use Google SSO out of the box, but can be modified to use whatever you'd like.
3. One you've created your project, go to Configure -> API Keys in the Clerk dashboard. From there you'll need to grab all of the API Keys and environment variables
   necessary for both the Next.js app and Convex. For information on applying environment variables, refer to [the environment variables section](/getting-started/init-env).
