## Setting up remaining dependencies

You will need to set up accounts for the following services. All of these services offer either generous free tiers, or usage based pricing. The Convex and Next environments will
need various api keys from each of them. See [the environment variables section](/getting-started/init-env) for more information on Configuring Next and Convex environment variables.

## Running the app locally

Now that we've set up all of the remaining dependencies, we should be able to run the dev server. Go ahead and run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

to start the development server. This will start the Next.js development server, as well as the listener which will automatically deploy changes to the Convex development
backend as you make changes.

Once the server is running, you should be able to access the app locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploying to production

Vercel should automatically create a new production build whenever changes are made to the `main` branch of your repository. If you haven't pushed any new changes since we set up our
project in Vercel, you can redeploy from your last commit through the Vercel dashboard.
