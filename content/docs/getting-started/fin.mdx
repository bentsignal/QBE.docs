## Setting up remaining dependencies

You will need to set up accounts for the following services. All of these services offer either generous free tiers, or usage based pricing. The Convex and Next environments will
need various API keys from each of them. See [the environment variables section](/getting-started/env) for more information on configuring Next and Convex environment variables.

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Exa](https://exa.ai/)
- [Fal](https://fal.ai/)
- [Google](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- [Open Router](https://openrouter.ai/)
- [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)
- [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/)

## Running the app locally

Now that we've set up all of the remaining dependencies, we should be able to start the dev server. Go ahead and run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, as well as the listener which will automatically deploy changes to the Convex development
server as you make changes.

Once the server is running, you should be able to access the app locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Generating suggestions

Once you get the app running, you will notice a large blank space in the center of the home screen. This is where the daily suggestions will be
displayed. They're set to update every day at noon UTC (see `./convex/crons.ts`). To generate them manually, you can run the function `ai/suggestions:generate`
from the Convex dashboard.

## Deploying to production

When any changes are detected on the `main` branch of your repository, Vercel will automatically create and deploy a new production build. Part of this build process includes deploying
the latest changes to the Convex production server.
