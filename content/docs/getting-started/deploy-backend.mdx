## Setup

1. Login or sign up for a [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) account
2. Create a new project
3. Install the Convex CLI
   ```bash
   pnpm add -g convex
   ```
4. Login to your Convex account
   ```bash
   pnpx convex login
   ```
5. Initialize your development environment

   ```bash
   pnpx convex dev
   ```

   _Note_: Make sure to choose the project you created in step 2

   _Note_: This should fail due to missing environment variables. Once it fails, hit `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.

6. Commit and push your changes

7. Set production environment variables

   Navigate to the project settings for your convex production deployment. You will need to generate a deployment key. Once you have this, set the following environment variables in the Vercel
   dashboard.

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-deployment-url>
   CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=<your-deployment-key>
   ```
