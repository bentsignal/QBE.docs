## Setup

1. Login or sign up for a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
2. [Create a new project](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Select the repository you cloned or forked
4. Override the build command to use the following:

   ```bash
   pnpx convex deploy --cmd='pnpm run build'
   ```

5. When you're ready, click **deploy**

_Note_: The build should fail due to missing enviornment variables. This is expected, proceed on to the next step.
