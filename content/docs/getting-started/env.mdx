## Setting variables for Next.js

### Development

Configured by the `.env` file in the root of your project. The project uses [t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env) to provide type safe, validated environment variables to the Next.js app. To see what
variables are required for the project, view `./src/env.ts`.

### Production

Production environment variables are managed through the Vercel dashboard.

### Development

Development environment variables can be set through the CLI or the Convex dashboard. To learn about setting them via CLI, read [the official documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#read-and-write-environment-variables).

When you ran `pnpx convex dev`, in the previous step, `.env.local` was created in the root directory. This is used
to manage the connection between your client and the Convex backend, and should not be edited unless you know what you're doing.

### Production

Production environment variables are managed through the Convex dashboard.

## Getting started

As we go through the next steps, we'll add environment variables as we get them. We can get started with a few though:

### NEXT_CONVEX_INTERNAL_KEY

In order to create endpoints in Convex that can only be called by Next.js functions, we'll have to create an API key that is shared between the two environments. We can
generate one by running the following command:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

This will give us a base64 encoded string that we can use as our API key. Add this to your both the Next.js and Convex environment variables. You can
create separate keys for development and production if you'd like.

### CONVEX_ENVIRONMENT

This is used in the backend to see if we're in development or production. Set it to `development` for local development and `production` for the production deployment. This only
needs to be set in the Convex environment variables.

### NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL

This is used to get the URL of the app in Next.js. For example, I have it set to `http://localhost:3000` for locally and `https://qbe.sh` for the production deployment. This only needs to be
set in the Next.js environment variables.
